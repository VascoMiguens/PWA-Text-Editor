## Description

This project is a single-page application that functions as a text editor, allowing users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, this Progressive Web Application (PWA) includes data persistence techniques that provide redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline. The following technologies were used to implement this functionality:

- IndexedDB: A browser-based database system that allows the application to store data on the client side;

- idb: A lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API, used to implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database;

- Workbox: A set of libraries and build tools used to implement offline support, including pre-caching static assets and handling service worker registration;

- Webpack: A module bundler used to bundle JavaScript files, generate an HTML file, a service worker, and a manifest file;
